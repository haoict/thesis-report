Nowadays, urban traffic is always one of the most urgent and difficult problem for every city in the world. One of the most vital solution for that problem is encourage passengers using public transportation. However, accquisition of information such as bus route, navigation by bus is somehow difficult for passengers. 
In this thesis, We focus on developing a system that collect and manage buses route information, as well as bring these information to passengers easily by mobile application with friendly user interface, provide fully function such as look up and navigate by bus. We will give assessment and explanation of the system based on the result.
%Nowadays, with the rapid growth of new mobile phone manufactures with a lot of different types of phones, along with software for mobile phones growing daily, the need in automated testing for phone increase drasmatically. Current testing method commonly used is tested by automated software. However, this method solves only software aspect, the effect of hardware on application behavior has not been considered.

%We propose a new approach, applying robotics technologies in mobile application testing. Our system uses the robot to interact directly with the phone. The operation is performed with high precision with delta robots. Along with that, the content of the device's screen is processed on computer with image content detection technology. All actions are controlled under testing script handling systems. With this approach, we can solve both software and hardware aspect of mobile phone testing problems. Furthermore, our approach does not require special software on the phone and can be applied on various kinds of phones even so mobile operating system.

%In this thesis, I conduct several test scenarios to test the accuracy of the robot as well as testing script handling system. Each script is run repeatedly, thereby produces result and accuracy statistics of the script. With the results, we hope that our approach can be applied extensively in device and software testing industry.
